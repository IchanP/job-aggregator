# Job Aggregator

This is a small project that aggregates job listing from various sources, such as Linkedin. It's built using TypeScript in Node.js.

The project is under active development, and is currently very basic, the goal is to make it more customizable without having to manually go in and change the code.

## Requirements

There are some requirements to run this project on your machine:

- You need an API key from RapidAPI as the project uses [LinkdAPI](https://rapidapi.com/linkdapi-linkdapi-default/api/linkdapi-best-unofficial-linkedin-api/pricing) through RapidAPI to fetch job listings. The basic plan is fine with the default configurations.
- Node.js 22+ installed on your machine.
- NPM 10+
